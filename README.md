# Dog-Cat-Classifier
## Introduction
This is a very simple CNN-Based dog or cat classifier I made as a practice for my machine learning knowledge. [Here's the notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cY79zu7eAX5dlnJ8PDZzwKCYwN3Fy76k?usp=sharing) I worked on to create this AI. And [Here's the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/chetankv/dogs-cats-images) I used to train this AI.

## How to run
### Prequisties:
```
tensorflow
keras
streamlit
numpy
PILlow
```

### Usage:

1. Make sure to be in the origin directory of this project.
2. Open your terminal.
3. Type `streamlit run`

There you go! You can now test the AI with different kinds of dog and cat images. But some very stretched resolutions may return strange results since the program resizes the given image into a 256x256 resolution for the AI. Feel free to fork this repo and mess with the code :)
