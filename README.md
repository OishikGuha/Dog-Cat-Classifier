# Dog-Cat-Classifier
## Introduction
This is a very simple dog or cat classifier I made as a practice for my machine learning knowledge. [Here's the notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cY79zu7eAX5dlnJ8PDZzwKCYwN3Fy76k?usp=sharing) I worked on to create this AI. And [Here's the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/chetankv/dogs-cats-images) I used to train this AI.

## How to run
### Prequisties:
```
tensorflow
keras
streamlit
numpy
PILlow
```

### Usage:

1. Make sure to be in the origin directory of this project.
2. Open your terminal.
3. Type `streamlit run`

There you go! You can now test the AI with different kinds of images and feel free to check the code :)
